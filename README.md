## Business Activities:

* Financial problem the company is trying to solve:
  * Democratize the credit card issuing market by providing a cloud-based, API driven credit card platform
  * This solution offers an alternative to mainframe-based in-house legacy systems provided by big banks (e.g. US Bank, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase) and the oligarchic  power of the third-party provider market controlled by Fiserv, Tsys, and Jack Henry.

* Company's intended customer:
  *   By creating B2B partnerships with companies interested in extending their brand reach through cobranded/white-label credit cards, Deserve in seeking to capture a portion of the $1T US credit card market that continues to grow - $154B or 17% over the last year.  These partner companies can be financial institutions, FinTechs, lenders, merchants or affinity organizations.

*   Competitive advantage over competition:
    *   The competitive advantage Deserve leverages is the flexibility of their cloud-based and newly coded solution.  This design advantage offers considerable speed to market.  Launching a credit card  program on legacy solutions such as Tsys or Fiserv takes a considerable amount of time (at least 6 months) and effort while Deserve promotes that it can launch a program within two months.  In fact, Deserve won the bidding for the AMC Entertainment card by being able to launch within 4 months of the RFP - a feat none of their competitors could match.
  *   Deserve hopes to attract new partners by offering this speed to market solution in launching new programs.
  *   In addition, they can offer the a mobile first user experience, a flexible environment, and the latest tools to manage all aspects of credit card issuing.
    
* Technologies:
  *   Cloud-based infrastructure
  *   API architecture
  *   New customer-friendly mobile based UX
  *   SaaS integration tools


## Landscape:

* Financial industry Domain:
  * The company resides in the Credit Cards as a Service domain.  A relatively new domain as costs to provide credit card servicing platforms have been reduced by cloud architecture and innovation in user experience design has been improved.

* Major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years:
  *  The major innovation in the domain has been the use of mobile-first design, cloud-based infrastructure, and API configurations that allow for a fully functional credit card processing system of record to be built apart from the mainframe architecture provided by Tsys and Fiserv or legacy internal systems used by big banks.  

  * The domain has been expanding with several new entrants over the past 10 years:
    * [Petal](www.petalcard.com)
    * [Avant](Avant.com)
    * [Zeta](zeta.tech/us/)
    * [i2C](i2cinc.com)
    * [Marqeta](marqeta.com)
   
* Competition for new partners is fierce.  Avant recently signed a deal with Major League Soccer.  All are actively trying to attract new partners to either create a new issuing program, or convince an existing issuer to convert their system of record to the new platform.
  
## Results
* Being a privately held company, there is no access to financial records such as SEC 10K filings.

* Business impact of this company:
  * Top 50 credit card issuer
  * A large owned-brand portfolio
  * 5 major partnerships

* Core metrics:  The company's key financial drivers are those of a credit card issuer - the more cards issued, the more balances rise, the more revenue earned.
  * Average Net Receivables
  * Total Number of Accounts
  * Active Accounts
  * Purchases on Cards
  * Average monthly purchases per account
  * Average monthly balance
  * Net credit loss rate

* Company performance relative to competitors:
 * Deserve seems to be leading the competition in the race for new partnerships.  Despite losing the very big deal of Major League Soccer to Avant, Deserve has more partnerships than others in the space.  More partnerships leads to access to consumers which leads to more cardholders.  Total accounts fuels all other metrics for the company.

## Recommendations

### Advice to the company
  *   The best path forward for Deserve is to lean into the current strategy of generating issuing partnerships by concentrating on the Fintech domains.  In addition, Deserve should seek out other FinTech companies to create issuing partnerships leveraging the FinTech partner's competitive advantage.  For example, partnerships with neobanks like Chime, Varo or Revolut would create complementary consumer financial products for both comaanies.  A partnership with Nova Credit would create access to new ways of underwriting new credit card accounts.  A partnership with Atlanticus, Genesis,  or Pagaya gives access to second-look credit and subprime lending. 

### Benefits to the company
*  The main benefit to the expanded partnerships with Neobanks is access to additional customers looking to expand their banking relationship with additional products. As this is already likely a key part of Deserve's strategy as evidenced by their recent partnership expansion with Rocket Mortgage, there is little need to elaborate on this course of action.  Instead the focus here will be on a partnership with a company that can give Deserve a competitive advantage against other CCaaS companies.
*  A Partnership with [Nova Credit](www.novacredit.com) would give Deserve access to new data sources to aid in underwriting.  The most important performance metric for a credit card partnership is approval rate.  Partners want their customers to be approved when they apply.  Having additional insights into those customers can help with the underwriting decision.
*  Similarly, a partnership with a second-look/sub-prime provider like [Atlanticus](atlanticus.om), [Concora Credit](about.concoracredit.com), or [Pagaya](pagaya.com) would give another method to increase approval rates.  These partnerships would send declined applications to these companies to see if they would offer applicants a credit card.  While this option would not increase the accounts directly, it would improve approval rate, customer satisfaction, and provide a revenue stream from referral fees.  Such a feature - a connection to second-look providers - embedded into the Deserve platform would be an attractive enhancement for prospective partners.  
 ### Technologies Utilized
* API Connections - Having a full well-documented API library available for partners to connect their solutions with the Deserve platform will enable Deserve to offer the best products and services from various FinTech providers to their card issuing partners.
* These technologies are appropriate for this solution because of the decentralized cloud-based solutions each company utilizes.
